It's a common and frustrating point in machine learning development when models plateau. It means you've likely exhausted the immediate gains from your current approach. Since you've already handled class imbalance and pruned features, your next steps should focus on **introducing entirely new information** into your models or **fundamentally changing how you frame the problem**.

Here's a breakdown of advanced strategies:

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering & Data Sources üìà

This is usually the most impactful next step. Your models are only as good as the data you feed them.

* **Macroeconomic and Fundamental Data:** As discussed, integrate data points that drive market sentiment and company performance.
    * **Interest Rates:** Key policy rates (e.g., Fed Funds Rate, Bank of England Base Rate) and bond yields (e.g., 10-year Treasury yield).
    * **Inflation Data:** Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI).
    * **Employment Data:** Unemployment rates, non-farm payrolls.
    * **GDP Growth:** Economic growth indicators.
    * **Industry-Specific Data:** For consumer stocks like WMT, consider retail sales figures, consumer confidence indices, or even energy prices.
    * **Company Fundamentals (from financial statements):** Revenue growth, EPS (Earnings Per Share) trends, P/E ratios, debt-to-equity ratios. Be mindful of data availability and look-ahead bias if incorporating these.
    * **Analyst Ratings/Revisions:** Changes in analyst buy/sell/hold ratings or earnings estimates can be strong signals.

* **Alternative Data:** Explore unconventional data sources that might capture market sentiment or unique insights.
    * **News Sentiment Analysis:** Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to derive sentiment scores from financial news articles related to WMT or its sector. 
    * **Social Media Sentiment:** Sentiment from platforms like Twitter (X) or Reddit.
    * **Web Search Trends:** Google Trends data for relevant keywords.

* **More Sophisticated Technical Indicators:** Beyond standard ones, consider:
    * **Volume Profile/Market Profile:** Analyze where the most trading volume occurred at different price levels.
    * **Implied Volatility (from Options):** If available, implied volatility from options contracts can be a forward-looking measure of expected price swings.



Data Still Needed ‚ùå
You still need to collect or build functions for the following data points:

Alternative Data:

Social Media Sentiment

Web Search Trends

More Sophisticated Technical Indicators:

Volume Profile/Market Profile

Implied Volatility (from Options)

Analyst Ratings/Revisions

### 2. Ensemble Methods & Model Stacking ü§ñ

Instead of relying on a single best model, combine the predictions of multiple models.

* **Bagging (e.g., Random Forest, Extra Trees):** Train multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the data and average their predictions. You've already explored Random Forest, but you could try other bagging models.
* **Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost):** Sequentially build models where each new model tries to correct the errors of the previous one. You've extensively used these, which is great.
* **Stacking (Stacked Generalization):** This is more advanced. Train multiple "base models" (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost, Logistic Regression) on your data. Then, train a "meta-model" (a simple model like Logistic Regression) to learn how to best combine the predictions of the base models. This can capture complex relationships between different model outputs.

### 3. Change the Problem Formulation üß†

If your current classification problem (`up` vs. `flat/down`) isn't yielding better results, consider alternative approaches.

* **Multi-Class Classification:** Instead of just two classes, define three or more: "Strong Up," "Slight Up," "Flat," "Slight Down," "Strong Down." This can provide a more granular target for the model to learn.
* **Regression Problem:** Instead of predicting a class, try to directly predict the *future return* (e.g., the `WMT_target_return_7D_0.015` column directly). You would then use regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, or even tree-based regression models like XGBoost Regressor). You could then define your trading strategy based on the predicted return value.
* **Time Series Forecasting:** While your current setup treats each day as an independent sample (mostly), time series models explicitly account for the sequential nature of stock data.
    * **ARIMA/SARIMA:** Traditional statistical models for time series.
    * **Deep Learning Models:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs or GRUs are designed for sequential data and can capture long-term dependencies.

### 4. Advanced Validation & Robustness üß™

Ensure your evaluation truly reflects real-world trading conditions.

* **Walk-Forward Optimization/Validation:** Instead of a single train-test split, continually re-train your model as new data becomes available. This is crucial for financial time series where relationships can change over time.
* **Stress Testing:** Evaluate your model's performance during different market regimes (bull markets, bear markets, high volatility periods, low volatility periods).
* **Transaction Costs & Slippage:** Incorporate realistic trading costs into your backtesting to see if your strategy remains profitable in practice.

Plateauing often means you've extracted all the signal from your current information set. The most effective way to break through this is to introduce new, uncorrelated information or to fundamentally re-think how you are asking the model to learn.
