1. Data aquistion



Feature Engineering (Advanced Technical Indicators, Volatility, etc.)

Experiment with More Powerful ML Models (Random Forests, XGBoost, etc.)

Refine Backtesting (Start with fixed size/transaction costs, then add more metrics and logic)

Hyperparameter Tuning & Ensemble Methods (Once you have a promising feature set and model type)
