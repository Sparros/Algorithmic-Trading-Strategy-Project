# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Project

This project details the end-to-end development of a machine learning-based algorithmic trading strategy. The pipeline covers everything from data collection and feature engineering to model training, optimization, and backtesting.

## 1. Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering  

The project combines **market data** with **macroeconomic indicators** to create a rich dataset for modeling.  

- **Market Data (via `yfinance`)**  
  - `fetch_multiple_stock_data`: pulls OHLCV for multiple tickers into a clean DataFrame.  
  - `_format_yfinance_columns`: flattens messy multi-indexes into readable labels (e.g. `Close_AAPL`).  

- **Macroeconomic Data (via FRED API)**  
  - `FRED_fetch_macro_data`: fetches time-series by series ID (e.g. CPI, Fed Funds Rate).  
  - `macro_data_orchestrator`: resamples macro data to daily frequency and forward-fills gaps so it lines up with stock data.  

- **Feature Engineering**  
  The dataset is enriched with indicators and transformations:  
  - *Technical*: moving averages (SMA/EMA), MACD, RSI, stochastic oscillator, ADX, ATR.  
  - *Returns & Volatility*: lagged features, true range, volatility stats.  
  - *Cross-Asset*: relative strength vs. benchmarks, inter-stock ratios, lagged correlations.  
  - *Macro*: transformed FRED series to capture cycles and shocks.  
  - *Time & Volume*: day-of-week/month effects, on-balance volume, volume ratios.  

The main entry point here is `prepare_data_for_ml`, which stitches everything together into a ready-to-model dataset.

## 2. Model Screening & Baseline Selection  

Before hyperparameter optimization, a **model screening phase** is used to identify strong candidates.  

- **Models tested**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost.  
- **Parameters swept**:  
  - Look-ahead window (how far ahead the model predicts).  
  - Return thresholds (what counts as a “meaningful” move).  
- **Metric**: F1 score (balances precision and recall, useful for imbalanced data).  

This stage identifies a baseline model and configuration to carry forward into fine-tuning.

## 3. Fine Modeling & Hyperparameter Optimization  

Once a baseline is chosen, the best models are fine-tuned with **time-series–aware methods**:  

- **Why not k-fold CV?** In time series, shuffling leaks future data → over-optimistic results.  
- **Solution**: *Time-Series Cross-Validation* — train on past, validate on future.  
- **Nested CV**:  
  - Inner loop: `GridSearchCV` finds hyperparameters.  
  - Outer loop: evaluates generalization on unseen folds.  
- **Result**: a tuned model (`.pkl`) that is properly validated and ready for live-style testing.

## 4. Backtesting & Strategy Evaluation  

Backtesting simulates how the strategy would have performed historically. Two levels are implemented:  

- **Single-Pass Backtest**  
  - Train once, test over a fixed period.  
  - Fast sanity check, but suffers from look-ahead bias.  

- **Walk-Forward Backtest**  
  - Rolling window: train on past, predict on next slice, repeat.  
  - Mirrors real-world deployment.  
  - Built with modular strategy classes (`ContinuousAllocationStrategy`, `MLProbabilisticStrategy`) so logic is clean and reusable.  
  - Results aggregated into performance reports and equity curves.

## 5. QA Sweep & Triage  

To reduce time spent on poor datasets or low accuracy models, the project includes two layers of quality control:  

- **QA Sweep**  
  - Runs automated checks at multiple points in the workflow.  
  - Examples:  
    - Detects NaNs, constant columns, or unexpected shifts in the data pipeline.  
    - Validates that feature distributions remain consistent across training and test sets.  
    - Flags suspicious prediction patterns (e.g., models that always predict a single class).  
  - Helps prevent silent errors from propagating into backtests.  

- **Triage**  
  - When something does fail, triage utilities provide structured diagnostics to locate the issue.  
  - Breaks down the workflow into checkpoints (data → features → model → backtest).  
  - Identifies which layer is producing invalid results, so debugging focuses on the root cause instead of guesswork.  
  - Example: a sudden drop in performance can be traced back to corrupted feature engineering rather than model logic.  

Together, these tools improve reliability, shorten feedback loops, and make it easier to iterate on new strategies.

## 6. Future Improvements  

Several extensions are planned to make the project more realistic and production-ready:  

- **Expand trading strategies** e.g., Momentum Crossover, Mean Reversion, Volatility Targeting, Earnings
- **Integration with live tick-level data** for testing strategy performance under streaming market conditions.  
- **Broker API connectivity** (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca) for paper trading and live signal deployment.  
- **Expanded asset coverage**, including futures, crypto, and fixed-income data.  
- **Reinforcement learning approaches** for adaptive strategies.  
- **Risk management modules**, such as position sizing, stop-loss logic, and portfolio optimization.  
- **Visualization dashboards** for monitoring backtests, live trades, and performance metrics in real time.

This process provides a much more realistic and trustworthy measure of your strategy's true performance.
