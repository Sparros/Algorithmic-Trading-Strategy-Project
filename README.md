Algorithmic Trading Strategy Project
This project details the end-to-end development of a machine learning-based algorithmic trading strategy. The pipeline covers everything from data collection and feature engineering to model training, optimization, and rigorous backtesting.

1. Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering
The foundation of any trading strategy is clean and well-structured data. This project uses a combined dataset of stock price information and macroeconomic indicators.

A. Data Acquisition & Cleaning
The first step is to acquire historical data from a reliable source. This project uses a multi-source approach, pulling data from both yfinance and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.

Stock Data
The yfinance library provides free access to Yahoo Finance's historical market data.

Core Functionality: The fetch_multiple_stock_data function acts as the primary data fetcher. It takes a list of tickers (e.g., ['WMT', '^GSPC']), fetches their historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, and combines them into a single, clean DataFrame.

Column Formatting: A key part of the process is the _format_yfinance_columns helper function. When fetching multiple tickers, yfinance returns a multi-level index. This helper flattens the columns into a more manageable Category_Ticker format (e.g., Close_WMT), making subsequent feature engineering much easier.

Macroeconomic Data
In addition to market data, the pipeline now integrates crucial macroeconomic indicators from the FRED API. This provides valuable insights into the broader economic environment, such as inflation, employment, and interest rates, which can significantly impact market trends.

Core Functionality: The FRED_fetch_macro_data function is responsible for fetching time-series data for a given FRED series_id (e.g., CPIAUCSL for the Consumer Price Index). Because macroeconomic data is often published on a monthly or weekly basis, the macro_data_orchestrator function is a critical component that resamples this data to a daily frequency and forward-fills missing values. This ensures that the macro data aligns perfectly with the daily stock data, which is a common challenge when merging different data sources.

B. Comprehensive Feature Engineering
Once the raw data is ready, a robust set of features is engineered. These features are designed to capture different market dynamics—from momentum and trend to volatility and inter-asset relationships—which serve as inputs for the machine learning model.

I. Technical & Statistical Indicators
These features are derived directly from the stock's price and volume history. The code calculates and adds a variety of widely-used indicators to the DataFrame:

Daily Returns & Lagged Features: Simple daily returns are calculated, and add_lagged_features creates shifted versions of key columns. This allows the model to "remember" past price and return movements, which can be highly predictive of future behavior.

Volatility & Price Strength: Functions like add_price_range_features, calculate_true_range, and calculate_atr measure price range and volatility. A higher True Range or ATR indicates greater price fluctuation, which is a critical signal for volatility-based strategies.

Trend & Momentum:

Moving Averages: add_moving_averages calculates both Simple (SMA) and Exponential (EMA) moving averages for different time windows. The relationship between these lines is a classic indicator of trend direction and strength.

MACD: calculate_macd generates the MACD line, Signal line, and Histogram. This is a powerful trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

RSI: calculate_rsi computes the Relative Strength Index, which helps identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market.

Stochastic Oscillator: calculate_stochastic_oscillator measures momentum by comparing a stock's closing price to its price range over a given period.

Directional Movement: calculate_adx calculates the Average Directional Index (ADX) along with the +DI and -DI. The ADX measures the strength of a price trend, regardless of its direction, which is a key input for trend-following models.

II. Intermarket & Cross-Asset Features
A unique and powerful part of this project is the inclusion of features that analyze the relationships between different assets.

Relative Strength: The add_relative_strength function compares the returns of the target stock (e.g., WMT) to a benchmark index (e.g., S&P 500). This helps the model learn whether the stock is outperforming or underperforming the broader market.

Cross-Stock Ratios: Functions like add_interstock_ratios and add_cross_stock_lagged_correlations are designed to test specific trading hypotheses. For example, comparing a retailer's price to a supplier's price can provide insight into supply chain health, while the correlation of their returns can reveal a leading-lagging relationship between them.

Volatility and Volume Ratios: We also calculate the ratio of the stock's ATR and Volume to the benchmark's, which can signal when a stock is experiencing unusually high or low activity relative to the market.

III. Macroeconomic & External Indicators
By merging macroeconomic data into the pipeline, the model can now capture the influence of large-scale economic trends. Features derived from FRED data can help the model understand the context of market movements. For example, a rising unemployment rate might signal a coming recession, while a change in the Federal Funds Rate could influence investor behavior.

IV. Time-Based & Volume Features
Finally, the pipeline adds several simple yet informative features that can help the model capture cyclical patterns and market sentiment.

Time-Based: The add_time_based_features function adds the day of the week and month of the year. This can help the model identify potential weekly or monthly effects, such as the "Monday effect" or "turn of the month" rallies.

Volume Analysis: Functions in add_volume_features and calculate_obv (On-Balance Volume) provide insight into the strength of a price move. A price rally on high volume is often considered more sustainable than one on low volume.

Orchestration
All these functions are combined and executed by the central prepare_data_for_ml and macro_data_orchestrator functions. These functions take care of the entire process—from fetching the raw data to saving the final engineered dataset—ensuring a reproducible and robust data pipeline for the subsequent modeling and backtesting stages.

2. Model Screening and Baseline Selection
The initial modeling phase is dedicated to a systematic model screening process. The primary objective is to establish a robust and well-justified baseline prediction capability by evaluating a diverse set of machine learning models. This step moves beyond a single model to a comparative analysis, which is crucial for identifying the most promising algorithm and data configuration before committing to intensive fine-tuning.

Methodology
To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, a controlled experimental loop was implemented to test multiple algorithms across different data-driven scenarios.

Model Selection: We selected four distinct models for this screening phase:

Random Forest Classifier: A powerful, non-linear ensemble method known for its robustness and ability to handle complex feature relationships without extensive data preprocessing. It serves as a strong benchmark.

XGBoost & CatBoost: Both are gradient boosting frameworks that are highly effective for structured data. Their strong performance, even with default or near-default parameters, makes them excellent candidates for an initial screening.

Logistic Regression: A simple, interpretable linear model that provides a crucial performance benchmark. It helps to determine if the complex, non-linear models offer a significant predictive advantage over a straightforward linear relationship.

Data and Parameter Evaluation: The script systematically iterates through various data configurations by adjusting two key parameters: the target variable's look-ahead window and the return threshold. This process reveals how model performance is affected by different definitions of a "significant" price movement.

Evaluation and Selection: A lightweight GridSearchCV is used to perform a preliminary hyperparameter search for each model. This allows us to find the best-performing version of each model within a limited scope. The models are then evaluated using the F1 score, which is a critical metric given the likely class imbalance in the target variable. The F1 score provides a balanced measure of the model's precision (avoiding false positives) and recall (avoiding false negatives).

The results of this screening process will be summarized to identify the top-performing model and its corresponding data configuration. This best-performing combination will serve as the final baseline model to be carried forward into the next phase of the project for more detailed analysis and fine-tuning.

3. Fine Modeling: Hyperparameter Optimization
After establishing a solid baseline, the next step is to conduct a more rigorous hyperparameter optimization. This phase is critical for squeezing the best possible performance out of the most promising models identified during the initial screening.

The Challenge with Time-Series Data
Standard cross-validation techniques (like k-fold) randomly shuffle the data, which is problematic for financial time-series. Shuffling the data would allow the model to "see" future information, leading to overly optimistic and misleading performance metrics.

Methodology: Time-Series Cross-Validation
To address this challenge, we employ Time-Series Cross-Validation. This method partitions the data chronologically, creating a series of training and testing folds where each training set precedes its corresponding testing set. This process accurately simulates how the model would perform in a real-world, forward-looking scenario.

Nested Cross-Validation: The script uses a nested approach. The outer loop performs time-series cross-validation on the training data, providing a more robust estimate of the model's out-of-sample performance. Inside each fold of the outer loop, a GridSearchCV is executed to find the optimal hyperparameters for that specific time window.

Final Model Training: After the cross-validation loop is complete, we retrain the best-performing model using the optimal hyperparameters on the entire training dataset. This ensures the final model has learned from all available historical data before being evaluated on the completely unseen test set.

Outcome
The final output is a highly-tuned model (.pkl file) that has been rigorously validated on historical data. This model's performance on the held-out test set provides a trustworthy estimate of its predictive power. It is now ready to be used to generate trading signals or for further backtesting.

4. Backtesting: Strategy Evaluation and Walk-Forward Analysis
This is the most critical stage of the project, as it determines the true viability of the trading strategy by simulating its performance on historical data. We evaluate two distinct approaches to backtesting, progressing from a simple-to-implement method to the industry standard.

A. The Initial Single-Pass Backtest
The first approach uses a single, pre-trained model to generate predictions across a fixed historical period. The trading logic then simulates trades on this period, considering real-world factors like transaction costs and slippage.

Benefit: This method is straightforward to set up and provides a quick, high-level view of potential returns. It is useful for a preliminary check of the strategy's overall logic and for a rough comparison against a simple buy-and-hold benchmark.

Major Flaw: The primary weakness is its susceptibility to look-ahead bias and overfitting. The model has been trained on data that overlaps with or directly precedes the backtest period, and the trading parameters (like allocation) are optimized for this specific dataset. This makes the results overly optimistic and unreliable for real-world application, as the strategy is not being tested on truly unseen data.

B. The Walk-Forward Backtest: A Modular, Robust Approach
To overcome the limitations of the single-pass method, we adopt the walk-forward backtest. This is the gold standard for evaluating trading strategies as it simulates real-world conditions where a model is periodically retrained and applied to new, unseen data.

By implementing your trading logic (ContinuousAllocationStrategy) as a separate, reusable class, you've made your entire backtesting framework highly modular. This allows you to:

Separate Concerns: The core backtesting engine handles the data and folds, while the strategy class focuses only on the trading rules.

Encapsulate Logic: Each strategy (e.g., ContinuousAllocationStrategy or MLProbabilisticStrategy) is self-contained and can be optimized and tested independently.

Improve Reusability: You can easily swap in new strategies to compare their performance without modifying the main backtesting script.

How it Works:

The walk_forward_backtest function orchestrates a series of backtests. For each fold:

A fresh model is trained on the historical data available up to that point. This prevents look-ahead bias.

The newly trained model then generates predictions for the next, unseen test period.

The Backtest framework applies your chosen strategy (ContinuousAllocationStrategy) to this new, unseen data.

The results from each fold are aggregated to produce a final, robust performance report and a combined equity curve.

This process provides a much more realistic and trustworthy measure of your strategy's true performance.
