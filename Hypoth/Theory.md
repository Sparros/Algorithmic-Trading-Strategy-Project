1. Data Collection (Deep Dive for UK Focus)
Interest Rate Data (UK Specific):

Central Bank Policy Rates:

Bank of England (BoE) Bank Rate: This is the primary policy rate in the UK.

Source: The official Bank of England website is the best direct source for historical Bank Rate data and Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting minutes.

UK Government Bond Yields (Gilts):

You'll need yields for different maturities, e.g., UK 2-Year Gilt Yield, UK 10-Year Gilt Yield, UK 30-Year Gilt Yield. The spread between these is crucial for the UK yield curve.

Source: The Bank of England website provides historical Gilt yields. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also publishes financial market data.

UK Interbank Rates:

SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index Average): This is the primary benchmark for short-term sterling interest rates, replacing LIBOR.

Source: Bank of England website.

Industry/Sector-Specific Stock Data (UK Specific):

Target UK Sectors:

Financials: Focus on major UK banks (e.g., Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC), insurance companies (e.g., Aviva, Legal & General), and other financial services firms listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). You could look at the FTSE 350 Financials Index constituents.

Real Estate: Focus on UK-listed REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and property development companies. You could look at the FTSE 350 Real Estate & Construction Index constituents.

UK Market Indices/ETFs:

FTSE 100 (^FTSE): The main UK large-cap index.

FTSE 250 (^FTMC): UK mid-cap index.

Specific UK Sector ETFs: (e.g., "iShares FTSE 100 Financials UCITS ETF" or similar) if you want to trade sectors directly without individual stock picking.

Source: Python libraries like yfinance (for UK-listed tickers, e.g., LLOY.L for Lloyds), or financial data providers like Refinitiv, Bloomberg, etc., for more robust historical data.

Relevant Economic Indicators (Contextual - UK Specific):

Inflation Data:

Consumer Price Index (CPIH, CPI): The main measures of inflation.

Producer Price Index (PPI): Measures inflation at the wholesale level.

Source: The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the primary source for UK inflation data.

GDP Growth: Quarterly and monthly GDP figures.

Source: ONS.

Employment Data:

Unemployment Rate, Wage Growth, Employment Levels.

Source: ONS Labour Market Overview.

Consumer Confidence/Sentiment:

GfK Consumer Confidence Index: A widely watched indicator in the UK.

Source: Often published by research firms, sometimes available via financial news outlets or data providers.

2. Feature Engineering (Concepts remain the same, data is UK-specific)
The principles of calculating rate of change, yield curve spreads (using UK Gilt yields), relative performance (e.g., UK Financials ETF vs. FTSE 100), lagged features, and deviation from trend apply directly. Just ensure all inputs are from UK data.

"Surprise" Features (UK Specific): Quantifying how much a BoE rate change or MPC statement differs from economist consensus estimates is hard but powerful. You might need to rely on historical reports from major financial news outlets (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, Financial Times) which often poll economists before BoE meetings.

3. Modeling Considerations (General principles apply)
The time-series nature, potential non-linearity, and choice between classification/regression remain the same. The key is to use your UK-specific features.

4. Testing & Backtesting Specifics (General principles apply)
Defining "predictable reaction," event-driven backtesting around BoE MPC meetings, and including transaction costs are universal.

Market Regimes (UK Specific): When testing across different periods, consider significant UK-specific events that might have altered market behavior or rate sensitivity:

Brexit Referendum & Subsequent Negotiations/Impact: This has had a profound and ongoing effect on various UK sectors and the wider economy.

Global Financial Crisis (GFC) impact on UK banks.

COVID-19 pandemic and the BoE's response.

"Anything Else?" - Key UK-Specific Considerations
Bank of England (BoE) Communications: Pay close attention not just to rate changes, but to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) minutes, speeches by the BoE Governor, and Inflation Reports. These provide forward guidance and insights into the BoE's future intentions, which the market reacts to.

UK Macro-Political Landscape: The UK's political stability, government fiscal policy (Budgets, Autumn Statements), and specific policies affecting housing or banking can significantly amplify or mute the impact of interest rates.

Sterling (GBP) Exchange Rate: Interest rate differentials often drive currency movements. The strength/weakness of the GBP can, in turn, affect export-oriented (FTSE 100) vs. domestically-focused (FTSE 250) companies differently, which might interact with interest rate impacts.

London Interbank Market: Understand the specifics of how the UK's financial system transmits interest rate changes throughout the economy.
